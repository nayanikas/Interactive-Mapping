Reflective Analysis 

This is a map that maps boundaries of wildland fires in conterminous United States and Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico for the period of 1984 though 2016. All fires reported as greater than 1,000 acres in the western United States and greater than 500 acreas in the eastern U.S. It aims to assess the frequency, extent and magnitude (size and severity) of all wildland fires  (includes wildfires, wildland fire use, and prescribed fires). 

There are many ways in which this map could be improved. Firstly, I had issues with the zoom of the initial map. Due to the large volumes of data, mapbox only allowed me to create a map where data could only be viewed at a zoom-level of 4. This was not ideal as it doen't allow the user to view burn patters on a bigger scale (original map was slightly smaller than state view), to overcome this, the map had to be simplified to allow for greater zoom levels.
